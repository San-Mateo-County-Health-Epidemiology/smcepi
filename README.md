The goal of smcepi is to provide functions that make data analysis
easier for San Mateo County epidemiologists.

## Installation

You can install the development version of smcepi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("San-Mateo-County-Health-Epidemiology/smcepi")
```

Broadly speaking, functions in this package fall into these categories:

- data visualization templates that follow the SMC style guide
- helper functions for connecting to Azure from R
- misc file management
